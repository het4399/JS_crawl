# Cleanup Summary

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Files Removed ✅

### 1. `dump.rdb`
- **Type:** Redis database dump file
- **Size:** Binary file
- **Reason:** Runtime data file, already in .gitignore, not needed in version control

### 2. `README.md`
- **Type:** Documentation
- **Content:** Old crawler-only documentation (~50 lines)
- **Reason:** Replaced by comprehensive `README-React.md` which includes all features

### 3. `docs/attrock_urls.md`
- **Type:** Test data / crawl results
- **Size:** 1,472 lines of URLs
- **Reason:** Test data or old crawl results, not needed for development

### 4. `docs/PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md`
- **Type:** Temporary documentation
- **Content:** Documentation about project reorganization
- **Reason:** Temporary notes, not needed long-term

### 5. `dist/` folder (entire directory)
- **Type:** Build artifacts
- **Contents:** Old compiled JavaScript files including:
  - `App2.js` (from deleted App2.tsx)
  - `main2.js` (from deleted main2.tsx)
  - Other outdated build files
- **Reason:** Stale build artifacts that don't match current source code

### 6. `docs/` folder (empty directory)
- **Type:** Empty directory
- **Reason:** All contents removed, no longer needed

## Impact

### Before Cleanup
- Root directory had unnecessary files
- Old build artifacts with renamed files
- Redundant documentation
- Test data cluttering the repo

### After Cleanup
- ✅ Cleaner root directory
- ✅ No stale build artifacts
- ✅ Single source of truth for documentation (README-React.md)
- ✅ No test data files
- ✅ Ready for fresh builds

## Build Artifacts Note

The `dist/` folder has been removed. It will be regenerated when you run:
```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist-frontend/` folder (used for React builds) remains intact and is managed by:
```bash
npm run build:frontend
```

## Documentation

Primary documentation is now:
- **`README-React.md`** - Comprehensive project documentation including:
  - AEO Analyzer features
  - Web crawler features
  - Project structure
  - Architecture overview
  - Development & deployment guides

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Clean slate for new builds
2. Rebuild backend: `npm run build`
3. Rebuild frontend: `npm run build:frontend`
4. Continue development with organized structure

## Summary

**Total Removed:**
- 4 files
- 2 directories (dist/ and docs/)
- ~1,520 lines of unnecessary content
- Multiple stale build artifacts

**Result:** Cleaner, more maintainable project structure focused on AEO Analyzer
